    <h1>Vertically Center a Variable Height Block Element</h1>
    <p>
        A variable height block element can be vertically centered by using absolute positioning. Set top to 50% to find the middle of the space.
    
    </p>
    <p>
        Since elements are positioned from the top, left corner we need to offset our reference. You can do this by using negative margins equal to half of the height and width.
        
    </p>
    
    <p>
        However, in a variable height block, we do not know the height. We must rely on JavaScript to tell us the height of the block.

            "Neptune was discovered one Neptune year ago. On September 23, 1846 Neptune was seen near its predicted location, with the discovery credited to Johann Galle, John Couch Adams, and Urbain Le Verrier. On Jul 7, 2011 Neptune completed its first orbit around the Sun since that day. Neptune is far from the Sun and very cold."
